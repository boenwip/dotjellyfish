Beginner Password Generator

## WIP Basic Password Generator. 

GUI allowing input of what you're saving the password for, and then generates a string of 12-15 characters of random ascii, storing it in a hidden file wherever you wish to save it (.jellyfish.txt).

I wrote this while learning about cryptography and wanted to start somewhere.

This has been useful for random websites I won't frequent that often and just want to make a one off account for.

### To add

Encryption.
